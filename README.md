# Fischer Jordan Data Analytics Assignment

## Overview

We are provided with a sample set of parcel invoice data for a shoe company that ships parcels weighing 4 lbs all over India via carriers such as Delhivery, DTDC, Bluedart, etc.

The core objective is to design a **normalized shipment cost model** that allows fair comparison of shipping costs across carriers.

This involves:
1.  Identifying base shipping costs vs. surcharges/penalties.
2.  Aggregating data to a single cost per shipment.
3.  Investigating data patterns and worst-performing shipments.

## Objectives

### 1. Shipment Cost Normalization
-   Determine which charge types to include (base vs. surcharge).
-   Aggregate charges to a single cost per shipment.
-   **Output**: Clean, processed dataset with categorized costs.

### 2. Comparative Analysis
-   Quantify how normalization changes carrier-level cost comparisons.
-   Clearly define inclusion/exclusion logic for charges.
-   Call out assumptions and edge cases explicitly.

### 3. "Worst 10%" Analysis (Bonus)
-   Identify the worst 10% of shipments by normalized cost.
-   Analyze concentration by:
    -   Carrier
    -   Zone
    -   Charge Type
-   Estimate their contribution to total spend.

## Deliverables

1.  **Codebase**: Python scripts for data processing and analysis.
2.  **Report/Storytelling**: Clear documentation of findings, assumptions, and methodology.
3.  **Visualizations**: Charts supporting the analysis.

## Key Considerations

-   **Deep Investigation**: Look for patterns beyond the surface.
-   **Storytelling**: Present findings in a structured, clear narrative.
-   **Technical Fundamentals**: Demonstrate robust data handling and clean code.
